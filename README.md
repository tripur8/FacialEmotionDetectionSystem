## PROJECT EXPLANATION
❄️ Nowadays we have so many websites that categorize movies based on their successful
ratings, actors who have worked on it, their box office collections and so on and also categorise songs based on the users previou choices.

❄️ People watch movies or listen to songs so that they can relate to the feel of it , to relieve themselves etc..


❄️ But there are hardly any
websites which recommend movies/songs based on user's current emotions. 

❄️ The proposed entertainment system eliminates the
time-consuming and tedious task of manually Segregating or grouping movies/songs into different
lists and helps in generating an appropriate movie/song list based on an individual's emotional
features.


❄️ The system will play the role of a real time application which
captures the users live emotions and suggests movies/songs based on that. So the following
operations take place:

        ✨ Instructions through voice assistant
        ✨ Face Detection
        ✨ Analyzing facial expression
        ✨ Emotion detection
        ✨ Genre allocation based on emotion detected
        ✨ Suggestion of movies/songs

<br>

## Getting Started

✅ Detailed instructions regarding how to retrain the model and make predictions on the video is given in the pdf named: <b>Project_Instructions.pdf<b>
